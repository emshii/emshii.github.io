    </ul>

    <p>My hometown is in El Nido Palawan, this is where i grew up until Junior High School.
      After Junior High i transferred school in Puerto Princesa Palawan and started learning here. </p>
    
    <p>The reason why i chose BSIT is because since i was young i was fond of technology and decided that when i grow up 
       i'll create a game so great that every gamer can enjoy it.</p>

    <p>While growing up i realized that Living is not that easy, there are many conflicts in the world.
      But that doesn't mean that i should give up. Here are the people that is keeping me motivated to live.
